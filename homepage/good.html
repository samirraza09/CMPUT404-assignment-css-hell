            <p>
                Zachary "Sneaky" Scuderi is a former professional League of Legends player for Cloud9.
                He played the bot lane position, and for the duration of his 6 year tenure with C9 he 
                was considered a top 3 AD Carry in the LCS. While Sneaky was a pro player he also had a 
                very popular Twitch stream. He mostly streams his League of Legends gameplay but also plays
                other games. Since he retired as a professional player he has began co-streaming LCS games
                with former teammate William "Meteos" Hartman and former AD Carry rival Yilliang "Doublelift"
